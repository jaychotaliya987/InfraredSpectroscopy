## Successive peaks in P and R branches

| P-Branch ($cm^{-1}$) | R-Branch($cm^{-1}$) |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1167.92  | 1168.814 |
| 1167.1   | 1169.714 |
| 1166.33  | 1170.5   |
| 1165.5   | 1171.448 |
| 1164.7   | 1172.3   |

The average distance between two adjacent peaks are,

for R branch, $2B = 0.805cm^{-1}$, B =  $0.402 cm^{-1 }$, $I =6.954* 10^{-46} kgm^{-2}$

for P branch, $2B = 0.8714cm^{-1}$, B = $0.435 cm^{-1}$,  $I =6.424* 10^{-46} kgm^{-2}$

literature value of I is $6.680777 -46 kg m^{-2}$. average I from experiment is $6.689380* 10^{-46} kgm^{-2}$
with the error of $0.128%$
